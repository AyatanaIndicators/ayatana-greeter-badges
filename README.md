# Credits

Ayatana Greeter Badges have been factored out from Arctica Greeter.
Arctica Greeter originally started as a fork of Unity Greeter 16.04.2, a
greeter developed for Ubuntu by Canonical. Several of the session badges
shipped in Arctica Greeter have earlier been taken from Slick Greeter,
the LinuxMint fork of Unity Greeter.
